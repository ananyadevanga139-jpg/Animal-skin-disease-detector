# Animal-skin-disease-detector



A deep learning–based project that detects skin diseases in animals using CNN and image processing techniques.


---

📌 Project Overview

The Animal Skin Disease Detector is designed to classify images of animal skin and identify possible diseases.
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of various skin conditions.

This project helps in:

Early identification of skin diseases

Reducing diagnostic time

Supporting veterinarians and farmers

Building a real-time AI-based solution



---

🚀 Features

Image classification using CNN

Handles multiple skin disease categories

Simple UI (if you added Flask/Streamlit)

High accuracy with deep learning

Easy-to-use prediction script



---

🧰 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib

(Optional) Flask / Streamlit for UI
